# L3G4200D Gyro Sensor Library for STM32F103C8T6
This a the gyro sensor L3G4200D Library for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller.
The library is quite simple and needs a lot of improvement.

## Introduction
This library helps you communicate with the L3G4200D gyro sensor, allowing you collect data on motion and angular rotation
I hope this template helps you write an effective RRADME for your project!
